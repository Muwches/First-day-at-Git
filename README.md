# First-day-at-Git
This is my first take of GitHub. Everything is just practicing right now.

Hi Earth people!
My name is Hannington, and I want to say that GitHub is a great place for 
me to explore the skills I have in regards to coding and designing. 
I love Java, C#, JavaScript, PHP, and Perl, and not forgetting my one and only HTML5, yeah!!!
I look forward to this wonderful time at GitHub, and getting to know the wonderful Earth people on GitHub.
